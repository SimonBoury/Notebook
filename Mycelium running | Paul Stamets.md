## Mycelial mind
This book is designed to show readers how to grow mushrooms in gardens, yards and woods for the purpose of reaping both personal and planetary rewards.

Fungi are the interface organisms between life and death. p.1

I wonder what would happen if there were a United Organization of Organisms where each species gets one vote. Would we be voted of the planet? p.1

These extenalized neurological nets sense any impression upon them, from footsteps to falling tree branches, they could relay enormous amounts of data regarding the movements of all organisms trough the landscape. p.7

I believe that the internet is simply an archetypal form, the inevitable consequence of a previously proven evolutionary model, which is also seen in the human brain. p.10

In the 1960s the concept of better living trough chemistry became the ideal as plastics, alloys, pesticides, fungicides and petrochemicals were born in the laboratory. p.11

Toxic insecticides often confer a temporary solution until tolerance is achieved. When the natural benefits of fungi have been repressed, the perceived need for artifical fertilizers increases, creating a cycle of chemical dependence, ultimately eroding sustainability. p.11

The rule of nature is that when a species exceeds the carrying capacity of its host environment, its food chain collapses and diseases emerge to devastate the population of the threatening organism. p.11

## Mushroom life cycle
Mushroom > spores > germination into threads of cells (hyphae) > hyphae grows and branches, forms connection with compatible hyphae > mycelial mat > gathering nutrients & moisture > primordium (baby mushrooms/pinheads) p.12

Spores are produced from basidia in a specialized layer of cells called hymenium. p.15

Mushrooms can be grown from spores or tissue. Each mating of two spores expresses but one possible phenotype. Using a piece of tissue is like cloning therefore captures the exact gebetic composition. p.18


## Mushrooms in their natural habitat

#### Saprophytic mushrooms
*The decomposers*

Building soil is the primary outcome. Feed from dead plants, insects and other animals.

Fungi secrete enzymes (digest lignin, cellulose, petroleum products and many molecules held by hydrogen-carbon products) and acids that degrade large molecules of dead plants into simpler molecules. > reassembles simple mol. into building blocks (polysacchariden)

They recycle carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosporus into nutrients for living plants, and other organisms.

#### Mycorrhizal mushrooms
*Fungus and plant partnerships*

Mycorrhizal mushrooms form mutual beneficial relationships with plants.  (from grasses to pines)

Ectomyco... (exterior sheats around the roots, it brings distant nutrients and moisture to the host plant, fungi get plant-secreted sugar) vs endomyco... (invade interior root cells)

#### Mutualistic mushrooms
*Fungal partnerships*

Mutual benefit, usually to prevent infestation by parasites and gather nutrients.

One of our tasks is to better Fukuoka's pioneering method and customize it for mycorrstoration projects

> Seedballs of clay-soil pellets could contain spores or spawn of desired mushrooms mycorhizea to encourage growth of plant and edible fruiting bodies.

#### Parasitic mushrooms

## Medicinal mushroom forest

A forest ecosystem cannot be defined without its fungi because they govern the transition between life and death and the building of soils, all the while fueling numerous life cycles. p.35

Estimates are that two-thirds of our pharmaceutical still originate from nature. (Taxol is an example hereof) p.37

The old-growth mycoforests suddenly become more valuable not as a timber source but as a remedy against natural or weaponized diseases. p.39

Mushrooms share a deeper evolutionary history with animals than with any other kingdom, so humans and mushrooms share risks of infection from some of the same microbes. p.41

Mycelium has just a single cell wall protecting it from hundreds of millions of hostile microbes in every gram of soil. By "sweating" out antibiotics they manage to control this. (sweats are called *exudates* or *secondary metabolites*) p.42

Mushrooms offer protection from infectious diseases in at least three ways: p.45
- antimicrobial agents (antibiotics)
- increased immune system natural defense
- mycelial mats for mycofiltration reducing risk from environmental sources (sewage feedlots & slaughterhouses)

A blight is specious-specific parasitic invasion by a fungus that kills many members of the target species in a community. Fungal blights can fell a forest of firs and oaks in a matter of months. Nonblighting fungi, which also have medicinal or nutritional uses for humans may be the best defense against blighting fungi. . 47

I believe it's better to search our planet's existing genetic diversity for naturally resistant crops instead of birthing gmo's. P.53

We must continually reevaluate the benefits of mycorestoration in contrast to their risks. By the same token, we must also continuously reevaluate the costs and risks of doing nothing. P.53

## Mycorestoration

Mycorestoration is the use of fungi to repair or restore the weakened immune systems of environments. P.55

Soil is ecological currency, if we overspend it or deplete it, the environment goes bankrupt. P.55

Mycorestoration practices can be implented in the following ways: mycofiltration, mycoforestry, mycoremediation, mycopesticides. P.55

Resident species are nature's recommendations for habitat restoration. P.56

#### Mycofiltration

Habitats infused with mycelium reduce downstream particulate flow, mitigate erosion, filter out bacteria and protozoa and modulate water flow through the soil. P.58

Rhizomorphic mycelium can hold 30.000 timnes its mass. This places into perspective how tenacious mycelial mats can be when they infuse habitats with their cullular networks. P.60

I am keen on using bunker spawn - mycelium in burlap sacks - to build mycelial buffers to capture microbes and nutrients. P.64 - extensions on p.151-154

The ability to mineralize substrates - to make minerals available by remvoing them from a tightly bound matrix - helps mycelia encroach into barren habitats, disintegrating rocks and settting the stage for lichens. P.64

Plowing the stubble into the soil releases 41 percent more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere compare to no-till practices, where the carbon dioxide stays within the soil's biosphere. P.65

Many temperatue mushroom species produce antifreeze agents also help prevent the soilsfrom freezing, conferring protection to the plants in extreme cold. Additionally soils infused with actively growing mycelium benefit from thermogenesis -the natural escalation of temperature- as the mycelium decomposes organic matter and releases heat, water and carbon dioxide. P.66

As we advance towards sustainability, I see these three systems, mycorestoration, permaculture and living machines (use of estuary ecosystems to break down toxis wastes, Todd and Todd 1993) as being essential components in a new model of habitat restoration, future perfection will be founded on synergizing these three systems. P.68

## Mycoforestry

Placing an economic value on an aesthatic like unspoiled landscapes, an incalculable asset like biodiversity, or yet undiscovered mycomedicines confronts the simplistic conclusions of conventional economic models that compare timber and mushrooms as two mutually exclusive commodities. p.70

Mushroom species producing enzymes to break down VX and antibiotics to protect cells from pox and Hiv viruses dramatically increase the value of old-growth forests. p.71

The bottom line is that we have to focus on carbon cycles and raise the nutritional plateau in timberlands by accelerating decompositioni of wood debris and restarting plant cycles. p.72

To help nature recalibrate after logging, fungi must be brought into close contact with the dead wood so that the forest floor can act as a springboard for saprophytic and other fungi, which are instruments of the forest's immune system. p.73

Guidelines to mycoforestry:

- Use native species of fungi in the habitats needing restoration
- Amplify saphrophytic fungi
- Select species according to their interactions with bacteria and plants
- Select species that attract insects whose larvae are food for fish and birds
- Choose species that compete with disease rot fungi
- Choose species of known medicinal or culinary value
- Promote ground contact with fallen trees
- Use spored oils in machinery
- Retain wood-debris on site
- Use mycorrhizal spore inoculum when replanting forestlands

Burning sends carbon dioxide high into the atmosphere out of the reach of plant communities while also destroying the understory plants that would otherwise recapture this essential gas. Decomposition by fungi buffers carbon dioxide emission and cycles much of the gas back into the flourishing ecosystem. p.80

Wood chips on forest floor provide: delayed release of nutrients, mycofiltration membranes that reduce erosion and siltation, cavity habitats, moisture retention, protection against forest fires. p.81

#### Mycoremediation

Simply put, pollution is an environmental disease that kills. p.86

Fungi are adept as molecular disassemblers, breaking down many reclacitrant, long-chained toxins into simpler, less toxic chemicals. Mycoremediation also holds promise for removing heavy metals from the land by channelling them to the fruitbodies for removal. p.86

Since many of the bonds that hold plant material together are similar to the bonds found in petroleum products, including diesel, oil, and many herbicides and pesticides, mycelial enzymes are well suited for decomposing a wide spectrum of durable toxic chemicals. p.88

The natural order of oranisms sequencing through damaged ecosystems fluctuates, often repeated one: fungi > vertebrates & invertebrates > bacteria > plants > vertebrates & invertebrates > fungi > ... p.89

Goal is to provide a layer of mulch where aerobic mycelia are not suffocated and dipslaced by anaerobic competitors. p.89

Our job is to set the stage. Nature will finish the act. p.92

Current policy prescribes burning, hauling, and/or burying toxic waste. These steps leave a lifeless environment that is ecologically crippled or inert. p.93

Mycoremediation works first by denaturing toxins such as petroleum products, and second by absorbing heavy metals. p.94

Many mushrooms absorb radioactivity but some are hyperaccumulators with a peculiar ability to take in and concentrate elements such as cesium at thousands of times above levels in surrounding area. p.104

Saphrophytic mushrooms may be more useful for cleaning up recently deposited or surface contaminants, while mycorrhizal species offer a transport system from areas depper underground. p.107

**Arsenic**: used as a wood preservative. Mostly ingested through drinking water, excessive exposure can cause lung, bladder and other cancers. Matsutake (Tricholoma magnivelare) and Shaggy mane (Coprinus comatus) are both accumulaters of arsenic. Fungi grown along roadsides where exhaust fumes and asphalt supply arsenic should be avoided. p.107

**Cadmium**: caused by air pollution from for example steel smelters. Cadmium intake can harm the neurological system and the immune system and could cause cancer. Agaricus mushrooms are hyperaccumulators of cadmium. Agaricus bisporus aka the button mushroom often commercially grown should be monitored thoroughly. Oyster mushrooms absorb the least cadmium but still can flourish in environments heavily contamined with it. p.108

**Cesium**: Cesium-134 and cesium-137 are by-products of nuclear fission.

**Lead**: Mushrooms growing along roadsided where there is possible exposure from exhaust from leaded gasoline, should not be eaten. Especially Shaggy manes, which could be a possible bio-indicator of lead contamination.

**Mercury & selenium**: Mercury is a highly toxic metal that impears human and environmental health. Selenium, a mineral important for cellular metabolism bonds with mercury, making it nearly non-toxic. Selenium activates the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps the body purge itself from environmental toxins. Boletus edulis and agaricus species contain the highest levels of selenium. P.110

In reality, few landscapes are affected by just a single type of toxin. In many cases, overlapping and sequential mycelial mats are recommende over the long terrm in order to reduce multiple types of toxins. In some cases, mycoremediation strategies are best integerated into habitat restoration programs that also utilize the bioremediative propertie of plant, bacteria and algal communities. P.113

#### Mycopesticides

The spread of wood-digestingn fungi such as the artist conk is well known to precede or coincide with termite and carpenter ant invasion. The soften and moisten the wood, setting the table for these munching insects. P.115

The toxicity of certain chemical pesticides was not widely known until tons had been dispersed into the environment. The need for alternative, nontoxic pesticides is critical, since the medical and ecological impact of toxic pesticieds poses a cascading health hazard and a global threat to our biosphere. P.116

When insects come into contact with spores of these entomopathogenic fungi, the spores attach to the insects and germinate, boring hyphal pegs through the insects' exoskeletons using chitin-dissolving enzymes. P. 117

The compounding effect of recruitment means that a little mycelium can go a long way, as opposed to contact poisons such as pyrethrins, which quickly kill the insects before they can return to the colony and thus mus me used in large amounts. P.122

*Metarhizium anisopliae* does not infect plants, mammals, fish bess or other beneficial insects. P.122

We must reverse the course of conventional farming so that soil is created, not depleted. p.188

When sunlight moves across a bed of wood chips moisture moves up to the surface warms and flows out in the form of shortlived evaporation. This wicking effect aids fruiting provided condemsation occurs soon after sunlight has passed. p.188
