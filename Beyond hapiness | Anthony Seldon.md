# Beyond hapiness
*by Anthony Seldon*

***

If only we'd stop trying to be happy, we could have a pretty good time. - Edith Wharton

I firmly believe that is open to everone of us to live a life that takes us beyond hapiness. P.4

The happiest and most fulfilled people, and those who had the happiest children, were those who were either not particularly affluent or who had an attitude almost of indifference to their wealth. They had a perspective about money and recognised that thier relationshiops and their own ineer lives were of infinite greater value. P.8.

The pursuit of hapiness is often portayed as self-centred. Actually it is anything but selfish. Relatives, friends,.. all benefit when we are happy. Their life are diminshed when we are unhappy.  P.14

We act directly in order to achieve pleasure but we experience happiness as a by-product of living wisely. P.16

An excellent place to begin our journey is with the decision not to blame, rather to take responsibility for who we are and resolve to become the person we could be, were perhaps meant to be. P.27

Without choosing wisely we do not arrive at our desired destination, p. 28

> **Principles, value, inspirations**: Inspiration for me mostly exists out of people making bold decisions. Do the things which you feel are the right things, don't bother at what the mass of the people think, they are not even thinking. Doing things you feel are right will likely result in attracting people that are right, for you. I would never give away my most precious posession "time", for only the accumulation of wealth. Money or wealth should be accumulated with doing things you care about or think are valuable for either other people or the planet. So most valuable to me is freedom. Not the freedom by which you decide which car you want to buy. The freedom to do and act according to your own values.

> **Purpose, mission** Putting the money and time where the mouth is. Living a simple life where I am free to explore alternative ways of living/creating/sharing/...

> **Present aims and goals**: Building a sustainable and viable business to change paradigm on how land is used. Thinking/testing ways of living simple while balancing comfort and simplicity. Become an expert in the domains I am interested in.

Human beings are not very good at focusing on the long-term perspective and willpower is a notouriously limited resource. P.43

Better still, walk barefoot, which for me is one of the greatest pleasures known to human beings. P.54

A particularly healthy way to enjoy the pleasure of posessions is perhaps to derive joy from those things that are in any case necessity, such as clothes. Dressing well, in a manner that expresses our personality and taste, will enhance our enjoyment of daily life. P.55

Our body is a gift. We rely on them absolutely yet none of us is handed an owner's manual that explains how we should use them to best effect. Painful mistakes are often necessary to help us learn. P.62

Pleasure is a state of *having*, it is dpendent on a stimulus. Hapiness is a state of *being*. P.71

The pursuit of a good life that results in happiness on the other hand, is immune from legitimate criticsim. P.73

Accepting, belonging, character, discipline, empathising, focusing, giving, healthy: signposts to living richer lives. P.78

A narcistic personality disorders indicates an inflated idea of our own importance and an unwillingness or inability to empathise with others. - Sigmund Freud p.84

> Growth-mindset which reveals that we are perfectly capable of changing the way our brains operate, that we can become more resilient, less prone to depression and self-limitations, and eager to embrace challenges that once seemed impossible. *Though growth is the number one thing in industry, on a personal level people often have more of a fixed-mindset. Which is kind a strange.*

A life directed by our values is a virtous life. A life directed by inconsistent and superficial values is merely a virtual one. We choose. p.115

The notion that we are mere victims is a product of incorrect and lazy thinking. p.118

We can choose to become masters or servants of our bodies. p.122

You give little when you give your possessions. It is when you give of yourself you truly give. - Kahlil Gibran p.177

Have to understand that goal of life is not hapiness but joy, not comfort but meaning, not safety but bounless love.

> Living in a van is a case of meaning over comfort.

The only wisdom we can hope to acquire is the wisdom of humility. - T S Eliot p.209

Four stage model of life by Simon P. Walker in The leadership community. p.212

The unexamined life is not worth living. - Socrates p.217

Spirituality means waking up. Most people, even though don't know it are asleep. They never understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing we call human existence. - Anthony de Mello p.273
