# Growing trees from seed
*by Peter Gosling*

**Erratic seeding**: Sometimes trees produce very large quantity of cones,fruits or seeds and in other years almost none. This phenomenon is called “masting”. There are two possible reasons/explanations for this. First one is the ecological advantage that masting trees have because predators will not be able to eat all seeds during mast years. The other explanation is that “masting” is influenced by annual variation in weather.

**Unproductive seeding**: Survival strategy of a tree to produce unproductive seeds because predators will stop wasting their time to sort out the the good seeds from the empty and dead seeds.

**Seed dormancy**: Some types of seeds have a special prerequirement before they will germinate. Stratofication is one of these prerequirements.

### Collection of seeds
**Legume pods**: Best picked when turn from green to brownish-black and before they have fully opened and shed their seeds.

**Large dry single fruit**: Some can be collected from the ground, some will have to be picked from the tree because of wildlife eating the fallen fruits.

**Medium dry fruit cluster**: Collect clusters from the tree when they turn from green to brown. These clusters are mostly wind-dispersed.

**Medium dry w/ many seeds**: Some cones will disintegrate when mature so will have to be picked before this happen. Others will open and close to disperse seed depending on the weather.

**Fleshy fruit**: Depends on the fruit when and how to collect but a general rule is to collect when the fruit is ripe. 

### Storing of seeds
**Orthodox seeds**: These seeds can be dried and can even be frozen after drying, because these don’t contain enough water to freeze solid. Colder storage temperature will further increase the longevity of the seeds. Two important rules of thumb for storage conditions: Firstly, a one percent increase in moisture content will halve the storage life. Secondly a five degrees rise in storage temperature will halve the storage life.

**Intermediate**: Best to store these seeds at moisture level of 10-15 percent and frozen.

**Recaltritant**: These seeds can not be dried not be frozen and are therefore highly perishable.
