One state of the art incinerator consuming 2250 tons of household garbage daily would annually emit 5 tons of lead, 17 tons of mercury, 580 pounds of cadmium, 2228 tons of nitrous oxide, 853 tons of sulfur dioxide, 777 tons of hydrogen chloride, 87 tons of sulfuric acid, 18 tons fo fluorides and 98 tons of particulate matter small enough to lodge permanently in the lungs. p.47
