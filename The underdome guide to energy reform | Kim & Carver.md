# The underdome guide to energy reform
*by Janette Kim and Erik Carver*

***

Power, territory, lifestyle, risk

## Power
Anthropocene ad new geohistorical epoch that emerged when human habitation began to have measurable geological and ecological effects.

As a result of the exceptionally stable period in the Holocene, a resilient environment allowed our species to grown in number.

Role played by capitalist, consumerist, or industrial expansion in forcing anthropogenic change.

The violence wrought to humans by other humans coexists in the historical record with violence wrought on the rest of nature.

Planetary boundaries, Johan Rockstrom
Minimizing energy waste through privatising service costs vs democratic decision

Collectivizing resources among individual owners. p.36

In todays megastrucures, centralized controls allow for free-market heat exchange among buildings. p.40

## Territory
Buckminster Fuller and Shoji Sadao dome project over Manhattan took a very simplistic system design approach because they only focused on energy and resource consumption. Social and cultural exchange processes were not implemented and integrated in their designs. p.67-68

Systems thinking should be used by designers to make the physical environment not only less reliant but als more equitable. p.70

Not lose optimism epitomized by Fuller and Sadao that human-made problems can be solved usign design. not technology per se p.71

Econotopes: economies that drive the design and planning of our built environments

Carbon sequestration in cities, controlling emissions!

Visualization is essential from the standpoint of landscape. Green is very reductive, it’s more about the brown, the soil. p.102

Moving beyond reductive approaches of just using alot of plants and really understand urban landscape as a system.

## Lifestyle
Fuller believed that if customers accepted the option of only one house design, they would gain an exponentially greater range of choices in where to live and work as well as how to spend their time, energy and money. p.109

Instead of these time wasting objects, people would purchase the instruments of creativity. Photographic supplies, sports equipment, tools, laboratory equipment, musical instruments, art supplies,… p.110

How different is organic from conventional practice? It’s good that we’re not putting chemicals on it, but is it good enough? p.137

But if voting with dollars is the only way to register desire for political change, then I think we have a big problem. We don’t have a lot of transparency about the supply chains of our products, or what effects their production has on the places and people to produce them. p.140

Beginning to understand ourselves not just as consumers but also as actors, political agents and participants. p.140

## Risk
Risk… and power are two sides of the same coin. Risk presumes a decision, therefore a decision-maker, and produces a radical assymetry between those take, define risks and profit of them, and those who are assigned to them, who have to suffer the “unforeseen side effects” of the decisiom of others, perhaps even pay for them with their lives, without having had a chance to be involved in the decision-making process. p.148

Silicon valley toxics coalition monitors environmental and worker health risks associated with ever-growing use of silicon in photovoltaics and electronics. p.158

Buildings cooled with ethylene tetrafluooethylene pillows. p.162

If you start to price the economic costs of damages to the world economy you see that industries like coal are no longer economic. p.177
